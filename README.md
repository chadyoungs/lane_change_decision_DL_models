# Common Lane Change Decision Making DL models for Hdd dataset
</div>

inlcuding two models in this repo, rnn model and dop(driving operational picture) cnn model.

> rnn model copy and modify from other repo.

> while dop cnn model reference (including modify) following paper: A Learning-Based Discretionary Lane-Change Decision-Making Model with Driving Style Awareness  [arXiv:2010.09533v1]. [training with 2 A40, got 88.9% accuracy in my training process. However, there still exists a gap between the fine-tuned result in the referenced papar and my own try].
